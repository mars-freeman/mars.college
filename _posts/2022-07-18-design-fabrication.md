We are working with [Behn Samareh](http://www.machineinspiredart.com/) to design and build mobile living spaces. This may include residential space for Mars College, as well as small travel trailers like [tear-drop trailers](https://voyagertraveltrailers.com/diy-teardrop-trailer-construction-options/) or pickup campers. This will take place in Southern California with the workshop either in Niland or Bombay Beach. 

We are looking for people who would like to participate. Of particular interest are people knowledgeable in different aspects of digital design and fabrication including digital modelling (CAD) and CNC fabrication, as well as basic wood and metal fabrication

## Timeline

We are [accepting applications](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGwGCCvEFTOb4yauRoDrtShIVjVyNCZG7CtRjMzhqo8ghdRQ/viewform) now and will begin the initial design and research phase as soon as we have serious people onboard. The main Mars College program runs January thru March, but we are open to people coming as early as November if they can help with set-up. Once people are here we will build out the workshop and begin assembling a prototype. Once we are confident we have a viable model, build process and team we can shift into production. 

## Stages
- Online Research - Define the goals for the initial model and choose the platform and parts to use.  
- Prototype - Pull these pieces together to build a prototype and establish a production process.  
- Production - Work in a small team to construct high quality trailers over the course of a season.  

## Money

Thereâ€™s no cost to participate. Materials and tools will be available to people during the prototype phase. Teams selected to go into production will be given loans to buy materials for the production units. Loans will be repaid upon sale of the units in April with left over money shared between participants. There is no stipend, so ideally participants have money for food and other essentials. If this is an issue let us know in the application.
