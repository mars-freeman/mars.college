        Mars College takes place on an ancient dry lake bed in the Sonoran Desert. We adhere to the radical self reliance and leave no trace principles from Burningman. We construct an inner compound of communal structures framed with wood and pallet racks to provide closed in work spaces, kitchen areas, wind protection and shade.

        We work together to bring water from town, set up solar panels and generators for electricity, establish a high-speed internet link, and take care of all our necessities. With our basic needs met among a supportive community, we are free to <a href="/study">pursue our passions.</a>

        We are proponents of the vanlife lifestyle. People with livable vehicles can establish camp on Mars near our main community structures. If you’ve been dreaming about vanlife, Mars College is a good chance to build out a van or cargo trailer into the mobile tiny home you’ve been thinking about.

        We will build a number of rudimentary structures out on Mars that people can occupy. We will experiment with a number of form factors ranging from small capsules to large rooms. We will collectively build the basic structures and provide mattresses, but participants will need to flesh them out to make them 'homey'.

        We also have access to a some housing rentals in town (Bombay Beach), around a mile from Mars. These might be a good option for Martians who have more daytime work commitments.

        We encourage Martians to consider having some kind of personal transport to cover the distances between Mars and Bombay Beach. We are big fans of the <a href="/gallery/electric_unicycle/">electric unicycle</a>, and buy them in bulk. If you are interested in learning how to ride an electric unicycle with us, or joining our unicycling squad, <a href="/euc">please see this page</a>. We also have a collection of mountain bikes which can be freely borrowed.
